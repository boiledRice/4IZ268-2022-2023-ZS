                <p>Guinea pigs make great pets. They live for several years, so you can enjoy them longer than most
                    other
                    rodents. They
                    have different personalities and are very vocal, making it easy to know their individual identities
                    and
                    get attached.
                    They are fun to play with and very entertaining.</p>
                <p>Many people don’t realize this, but guinea pigs have a lot of personality. Some guinea pigs are shy;
                    others are bold and
                    dominant. Just because two guinea pigs look the same doesn’t mean they’ll act the same. Before
                    selecting
                    a guinea pig,
                    be sure to interact with her to ensure that her personality meets your expectations.</p>
                <p>Guinea pigs make a quiet yet audible vibrating sound when they are happy. Most people who don’t own
                    guinea pigs aren’t aware of this adorable sound.</p>
                <p>People who haven’t been around guinea pigs often don’t believe this, but these friendly little
                    animals
                    really do
                    recognize and respond to their owners. Many squeal with delight when they see their owners or try to
                    climb up the sides
                    of their cage to greet them. They are as interactive and friendly as dogs and cats.</p>
